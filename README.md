Swaggy Wallet

Here is a test I did in order to join LifeWorks. This web application is a simple online wallet which allows to deposit and withdraw money.
The application is coded with React. I decided to make a single-page application. I used React Router to do this.
The transactions are stored in the local storage of the application. If you want to see the easter egg, deposit more than 9000£ ;)
